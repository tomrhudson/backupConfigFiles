# backupConfigFiles
This is a bash script that copies various directories on a Mac (currently works on Catalina).

*The following files / directories are copied*

**Directories**
+ ~/.ssh/

**Files**
+ ~/.zshrc

# ToDo

- [ ] implement error handling
- [ ] consider adding prompt for the creation of a CRON job
- [ ] add ability to perform the copy of files/directories via SSH to a primate GitHub repo

## Features / Example
TBA

## Motivation

I've lost these files multiple times, or spend time looking where the files are to simply copy them to another machine. I created this to copy these files quickly and easily.

## Requirements
This script has only been tested on:
+ macOS Catalina Version 10.15.6

## Installation or Getting Started

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project, e.g.,

	git clone https://github.com/tomrhudson/backupConfigFiles.git
